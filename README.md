## Hello There!

Welcome to my Github. I am a programmer who loves learning new programming languages and studying across different fields. I have been programming since first year high school where I learned visual basic for robotics, and basic web development. Currently, I am spending all of my free time studying full-stack development using [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) so that I have the skills necessary to break into the industry. As someone who has also gamed for much of their life, one of my hobbies is to code Unity projects using C#. It has given me a great appreciation for game developers as well as the huge amount of effort that goes into creating even simple indie games. What can I say, coding is awesome and gives me a really good feeling of accomplishment when I overcome a challenge after days or weeks of effort.
