## Hello World!

Welcome to my Github. I am a programmer who loves learning new programming languages and studying across different fields. I studied Robotics & Automation in college and fell in love with programming. Currently, I am a Web Developer at Humber College in Toronto, Canada. 

To anyone who wants to become a developer, I highly recommend [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) which taught me everything I needed to land this job for the low low price of $FREE. If you're into full-stack development and are willing to put in the effort to learn, check it out!
